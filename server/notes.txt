okaaaaay... so now I actually need to figure out how I'm gonna do this.

options:
socket.io and just push updates when something changes
  -batches all active states as friendlyname:status pairs in json
  and pushes when anyone hits a toggle route


I guess the question I ought to be asking myself is: does this project
have a need to be live or to maintain a consistent connection to
the server. the answer, of course is no. This is going to be 
1-2 people max ever, even a fairly aggressive heartbeat should be 
more than enough to keep things synchronized.
